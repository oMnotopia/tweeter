# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

## Features

Users can type Tweets of up to 140 characters. When the Tweet is submitted it is added to the top of the scrolling page. There is also the ability to hide or display the new tweet section by clicking on the "Write a new tweet" or the arrows below that. When a user scrolls down the page a button appears in the bottom right which will scroll the screen to the top of the page.
